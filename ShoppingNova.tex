\begin{abstract}This paper explores a strategy to increase visitors to online shopping malls by introducing a visually distinctive concept. We propose the use of a galaxy-themed visual representation to differentiate the shopping experience. In this model, each product is represented as a star or planet, forming clusters (categories) of products, which then combine to create a galaxy-like shopping environment. The design will be implemented in a stepwise fashion, with each level revealing a new visual layout, enhancing the user's experience as they explore the shopping mall. We believe that this unique visual approach can attract more visitors by providing an engaging and memorable user interface.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation}

In modern online shopping malls, customer experience is prioritized beyond mere product sales and display. As internet users' attention spans continue to shorten, they seek fresh and engaging online experiences. Visually appealing design plays a critical role in shaping the customer's first impression, encouraging longer engagement on the site, and increasing the likelihood of purchase conversion. A user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing website not only differentiates a business in a competitive market but also enhances customer satisfaction and leaves a lasting impression.

In the highly competitive e-commerce landscape, a distinctive visual design is a powerful tool for fostering emotional connections with customers, surpassing the realm of simple aesthetic appeal. Moreover, a visually differentiated online shopping platform can positively impact the attraction of potential new customers. Therefore, it is both valuable and necessary to pursue improvements in the website's visual design to better engage and retain a broader customer base.

\subsection{Problem Statement (Client's Need)}

The current shopping mall website functions adequately in terms of providing product information and facilitating payment systems, but it lacks the visual design and user experience needed to attract a broader customer base. Specifically, there is little incentive for customers to visit the website unless they are explicitly intending to make a purchase. However, if the website could draw in potential
customers through visual appeal, beyond those simply looking to buy, it would naturally increase product exposure and make a lasting impression. Additionally, aesthetically pleasing designs can enhance user engagement by encouraging visitors to spend more time on the site, thereby increasing the
likelihood of conversion.

This indicates significant potential for growth in terms of customer acquisition and purchase conversion rates for the shopping mall website.
Modern consumers seek emotional satisfaction through intuitive and sensory-driven experiences, and during this process, they tend to form long-term relationships with brands that leave a lasting impact. Therefore, the objective of this project is to enhance
the website's visual appeal, with the goal of attracting and retaining more customers over the long term.

\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
\item TheDropStore

TheDropStore is an online platform that sells a variety of kits to spread awareness about solving water crises. This platform uses 3D elements to provide a differentiated shopping experience. Each product is rendered in a 3D model, allowing the user to experience the real object as if they were looking at a real object. These features allow the customer to enjoy the product search process itself and naturally sympathize with the message about the water crisis.

\item IKEA Place 

IKEA Place is an app that enables furniture to be placed in a virtual space using AR technology. Users can see how 3D furniture models are placed in the space by fusing them with their real environment. This allows users to intuitively identify the harmony of size, color, and design. However, this arrangement requires 3D model files, and if the size or ratio of the model is inaccurate, there is a drawback that can lead to a difference between the virtual and actual arrangements.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Development Environment}

\subsection{Choice of Software Development Platform}

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\parindent}{2ex}
\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
\item Programming Languages

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\parindent}{2ex}
\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
\item JAVA

Java is an open-source, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. Key features of Java include support for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), automatic memory management through garbage collection, robust exception handling, and multi-threading capabilities. Java supports various frameworks and libraries, and we choose spring boot that support this language.

\item Typescript

TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript and that developed by Microsoft. As a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript is compatible with JavaScript code and includes the latest ECMAScript features. It is designed especially to improve code stability and maintainability at any scale. Key features of TypeScript include static type checking, interfaces, type inference, and support for classes and inheritance. These features makes it suitable for stable development and maintain a high-level of code quality.
We decided to use Next.js and have experience using typescript, so we chose this language.

\end{itemize}

\item Frameworks \& Libraries

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\parindent}{2ex}
\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
\item Spring Boot

Spring Boot is a Java-based framework that allows rapid development of web applications without complex configurations. In the shopping mall project, Spring Boot serves as the backend, handling essential functions such as user authentication, product and order management, and shopping cart features. It communicates with the frontend via RESTful APIs, and integrates with the database through JPA (Java Persistence API) and Hibernate for efficient CRUD functionality. Spring Boot’s robust architecture ensures scalability and maintainability, making it ideal for large-scale applications.

\item NextJS 

Next.js is a React-based full-stack framework that supports both client-side and server-side rendering. In implementing the frontend of the shopping mall, Next.js enhances page load speed and SEO by pre-fetching data on the server side. Using this library, we build and deploy shopping mall page.

\item Three.js \& React-three-fiber

Three.js is a JavaScript-based 3D graphics library that enables rendering complex 3D scenes and animations in the browser. Operating on top of WebGL, Three.js provides a wide range of APIs for manipulating 3D objects, cameras, lighting, and textures without requiring developers to write direct WebGL code.

React-three-fiber(R3F) abstracts Three.js’s capabilities into React components and hooks. With R3F, developers can utilize React’s state management to easily control dynamic 3D objects, blending standard React components with 3D elements to create immersive user interfaces. Using this library, we will show stars and galaxy elements in a 3D viewer for the products and categories of the shopping mall. 

\end{itemize}

\item Database

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\parindent}{2ex}
\setlength{\parskip}{0.5em}
\item MySQL

MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) that is open-source, free, and suitable for both small and large applications. It is known for its speed, reliability, scalability, and ease of use. Unlike some RDBMS systems, MySQL does not come with built-in GUI management tools, so users typically rely on command-line interfaces or front-end desktop software and web applications to create, manage, back up, and interact with databases. The official MySQL frontend tool, MySQL Workbench, developed by Oracle, is freely available for use. MySQL is cross-platform and adheres to the ANSI SQL standard.

\end{itemize}

\setlength{\parindent}{2ex}

\item Web Scraping by Listly (Chrome Extension)

For the LG Electronics shopping mall's new UI application project, product information, particularly for TVs and refrigerators, was scraped from the LG Electronics shopping mall webpage using Listly (a Chrome Extension) and saved as an Excel file.

\item Data Cleaning \& Wrangling by Excel (Manually)

The scraped data was manually cleaned and wrangled using Excel. Rows with null values in essential fields were removed, and only the necessary columns were retained.

\item Converting \& Formatting by Python (File I/O)

The Excel data was converted into JSON format using Python. Additionally, image URLs in AVIF format were processed and converted to PNG format with properly formatted file names.

\item Uploading folders (json \& image) to S3 bucket

Finally, the image, product\_data, and users folders, along with the category.json file, were uploaded to an S3 bucket.

\section{Discussion}
\hspace*{1.2ex}
During the project, we faced several challenges. Designing the database structure was complex, as the process of collecting data and creating the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) required three revisions, leading to significant delays in uploading data to the S3 bucket. Implementing the database in Spring was also challenging due to permissions and policy-related issues when retrieving data from S3. Additionally, deploying the backend on an EC2 instance posed difficulties, as the t2.micro instance's low performance and lack of query optimization caused frequent server downtimes, which were temporarily resolved using a swap file. Finally, communication issues within the team, especially due to frequent changes in the frontend's technical feasibility, resulted in constant modifications to the required APIs, delaying their creation and testing. These challenges highlighted the importance of clearer communication and better team alignment to improve efficiency and minimize delays.
